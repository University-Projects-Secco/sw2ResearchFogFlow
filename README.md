####Adding devices:
At the state of the art the web portal is unusable for device creation: the user can only
choose between 4 predefined device types (Temperature, PowerPanel, Camera, Alarm).

Anyway, as shown from running the simulation, adding and configuring new device types 
programmatically, instead of manually, can be extremely easy: one only need to connect 
the device and it will be configured into the system using the data provided by the device
 itself. 
 
 #####Questions
 <ul>
    <li>Could the system create issues to strong-typed languages 
         (maybe because of missing attributes)?</li>
 </ul>

#####To-do
<ul>
    <li>Configure wearable device</li>
    <li>Define a fog function detecting idle time -> can stateful functions be created?</li>
    <li>Detect human-robot proximity?</li>
</ul>
